                            Born as the younger of two children in a Pastor’s home on November 17th, 1988. Pr. Joy George, my father, started his ministry in Gujarat, in the year 1979. He shifted to New Delhi in 1985. I had the privilege to be born and to be raised in Delhi. His ministerial requisites led us to follow him during his life. He was Pastor of the Oman Pentecostal Assembly (OPA) from 1998-2000, we lived there for two years and then returned to Delhi. After continuing ministry there for around 5 years, he was appointed as the Pastor of a Church in Sharjah, UAE. He continued his ministry there till 2011. He along with my mother returned back to Kerala, and while continuing to reside in our home in Manakala, due to sudden physical ailments, my father left his earthly abode and went to be with the Lord in 2013.

                            Being born in a Pastors home, ever since my childhood the only desire was to be a servant of the Lord. This heartfelt desire was transformed into a purpose by the frequent prophetical utterances by the servants of God. As I began to grow, I could clearly discern the struggles and hardships of ministry firsthand from my father who has left a huge legacy of 30+ years in the pastoral ministry in different parts of the world. This led to natural thought in my mind to pursue a secular degree, which would become beneficial monetarily to my family and also to do ministry thorough the earnings that I make. I had the opportunity to follow this decision, when I joined for B. Tech (Civil) at Chikamagalur. But God lead me to a different path and I started my theological Endeavour, at Faith Theological Seminary, Manakala in 2009. I often thank God for his timely interference, as my Father could see me getting actively involved in ministry before he went to be with the Lord. God enabled me to complete my B.D in 2014. Got married in 2014, to ‘Jenu’ and we are blessed with two lovely daughters Caris and Christine.</p>
